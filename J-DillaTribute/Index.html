        James DeWitt Yancey “came across like an angel on earth,”
        singer and songwriter Steve “Spacek” White told Fader
         magazine in 2006. Most people tend to speak of him this way.
         His contributions to music were indeed felt as angelic,
         no matter the alias—John Doe, MC Silk, Jay Dee, or J Dilla.
         But the James Yancey legacy is wide-ranging. What he contributed to
        the lives of others was duly as significant.</br></br>

        Yancey was born on February 7, 1974 at Zieger Osteopathic Hospital in
        Detroit, Michigan, the oldest of three children born to Beverly and
         Maureen “Ma Dukes” Yancey. The family’s musical lineage was strong;
        mother Maureen was an opera and classical music enthusiast and father
          Beverly a bassist, vocalist, and 25-year performance and recording
          veteran. “Jazz was the music he grew up with and was raised on,” says
          Maureen Yancey. “Since he was a couple of months old, he wouldn’t go to
          sleep unless he heard jazz, so my husband had to sing and play for him to go
           to sleep. It was his lullaby music as a child in his nursery.”</br></br>

           From age two, Yancey’s life was nothing but music—an incomparable passion in
           a music-laden family that included grandfather William James Yancey, a pianist
            in the silent film industry, and an uncle, Clemmer Yancey, a noted writer,
            arranger, and singer on the local Detroit circuit. Yancey’s first formal
            instrument training came on piano and cello, where he learned to read
            music before taking up drums, flute, and guitar. The family lived in
            Detroit’s roughly hewn Conant Gardens neighborhood, where Maureen kept
             her son out of harm’s way by requiring that church act as an alternative
             to any potential maleficence. If Yancey wasn’t at home working on music,
             he could be found singing in the Vernon Chapel AME youth choir,
             or as an acolyte for Holy Communion. He served as a both a Cub Scout
             and a Boy Scout, and was a member of Vernon Chapel’s Young People’s
             Division where he was active in community service.</br></br>

             <h4 class="text-center" style="color:#ffc200;">Music: Slum Village.</h4>

             Rappers R.L. Altman (T3) and the late Titus Glover (Baatin) met Yancey in the
             late 1980s. The two were also from Conant Gardens, and later, classmates of
             Yancey’s at Detroit Pershing High School, where Yancey would transfer for his
             senior year. In a predominantly Black, middle-class district like Conant, hip-hop
             in the late ‘80s was paramount, and the initial relationship between the three was
              based on word-of-mouth and the pursuit of neighborhood MC supremacy.
              Altman and Glover were part of one group and Yancey was one-half of a
              duo with Frank Bush. “Jay Dee wanted to challenge us in rapping,” said
              Glover in 2006. “He was like, ‘I can beat both of ya’ll.’” What began
              as competition, however, turned into camaraderie, as throughout their
              many rap battles, the trio showcased such individual talent that they
              became fans of one another’s respective styles.</br></br>

              “Baatin had started selling drugs,” says Altman, “and we went to confront
              him about it. He was like, ‘Man, fuck that….I gotta do what I gotta do.’
              That’s when we started Slum Village. Slum Village started as rebellion against
              Baatin, to get him to fall back into hip-hop again.”</br></br>

              <h4 class="text-center" style="color:#ffc200;">Battle with Lupus: A rare blood disease.</h4>

              Yancey briefly toured Europe in January 2003 in support of Ruff Draft.
              Upon his return to the States, he took ill. Exhaustion and malnutrition
              were initially considered possible causes, but a trip to the emergency room
              revealed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a rare blood condition.
              Despite ailing health, Yancey remained a creative force throughout the year,
              teaming with renowned Los Angeles producer Madlib for the landmark Jaylib
              LP and crafting a blistering remix of Four Tet’s “As Serious As Your Life.”
              At the urging of longtime friend Common, Yancey relocated from Detroit to
              Los Angeles in the spring of 2004, a year that also brought a return to his
              musical roots. One such effort was his work on mentor Amp Fiddler’s Waltz
              of a Ghetto Fly, and another, his interpretation of Jack McDuff’s “Oblighetto”
              for the Blue Note Revisited LP.</br></br>

              <h4 class="text-center" style="color:#ffc200;">Departure: Untimely Death</h4>

              Sadly, Yancey’s health began to worsen. Maureen moved to L.A. in November of 2004
              to be closer to her son, who became seriously ill as the year came to a close.
              He would eventually be diagnosed with Lupus, a condition wherein the
              body’s immune system becomes hyperactive and attacks normal, healthy tissue.
              The Lupus led to kidney failure and repeated dialysis treatments and hospital visits,
              yet Yancey wouldn’t let his physical state keep him from reaching out to fans. His work
              output slowed; Steve Spacek’s “Dollar,” and “Love Is” and “It’s Your World” from Common’s
              Be LP were notable 2005 productions. But his spirit was strong enough to allow him to tour
              Europe for a few weeks from November to December with Frank-N-Dank, DJ Rhettmatic, his mother,
              and friend and confidant Dave “New York” Tobman. “He wasn’t supposed to go,” says Frank,
              who had been friends with Yancey and Dank for nearly his entire life. “But he said,
              ‘You know what? I’m going to do it…I’m going to go and rock in a wheelchair.’
              It was like this was going to be the last time for him and his niggas to bring this shit full circle.”
              </br></br>
              Yancey spent his final months doing what he loved the most—creating music. He released Donuts,
              his third solo LP, on February 7, 2006 before passing away three days later at the age of 32.
